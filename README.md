- Master context management techniques: Learn strategies for maintaining relevant context throughout conversations and effectively referencing project resources for optimal AI assistance
- Implement visual communication workflows: Understand how to use visual inputs to communicate interface changes and leverage advanced planning features for complex codebase modifications
- Create custom automation: Explore how to build reusable custom commands and automations that streamline repetitive development tasks
- Extend functionality with MCP servers: Learn to integrate external tools and services for enhanced capabilities like browser automation and specialized development workflows
- Integrate with GitHub workflows: Understand how to set up automated code review processes and integrate AI assistance into your existing version control workflows
- Apply thinking and planning modes: Learn when and how to use different reasoning approaches for various complexity levels of programming challenges

# Prerequisites
Familiarity with command-line interfaces and terminal operations
Basic understanding of version control with Git

# Who this course is for
Software developers looking to integrate AI assistance into their coding workflows
Teams seeking to implement AI-powered GitHub integration for multiple workflows

# Notes
1. Claude Code failed spectacularly trying to run `npm audit` and `npm audit fix`. Will do some research and try again at a later date
2. @claude in github issues was not triggering claude code. Will do some research and try again at a later date.
